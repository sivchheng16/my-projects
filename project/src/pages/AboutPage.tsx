              VitaminAir began in 2018 with a vision to create a model of sustainable living that could help address the dual challenges of environmental degradation and community disconnection. Our founders, a diverse group of environmentalists, permaculturists, and community builders, came together around the shared belief that humanity needs new ways of living in harmony with nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the opportunity arose to protect 100 hectares of forest land in Cambodia that was at risk of exploitation, we mobilized quickly. Through a combination of private investment, crowdfunding, and grants from environmental organizations, we secured the land with the explicit mission of preservation and sustainable development.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then, VitaminAir has grown into a thriving community of permanent residents, regular volunteers, and visitors from around the world. We've developed sustainable housing, food production systems, and educational programs while maintaining our core commitment to forest preservation.

            <p>
              At VitaminAir, our mission is to develop and demonstrate regenerative ways of living that restore ecosystems, strengthen communities, and provide fulfilling livelihoods while minimizing ecological impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that by combining traditional wisdom with appropriate modern technologies, we can create systems that meet human needs while enhancing the health of the planet. Through our living example and educational programs, we aim to inspire and empower others to adopt more sustainable ways of living.

            <p>
              We envision a world where human communities live in regenerative relationship with the natural world, where forests thrive, biodiversity flourishes, and people are connected to the land and to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              We see VitaminAir as a seed for this visionâ€”a living laboratory where we explore what truly sustainable living looks like in practice. Our hope is that the models we develop can be adapted and replicated in diverse contexts around the world, contributing to a global transition toward ecological harmony.
